The Primary Adaptation of Affective English Norms for Turkish.

Tables S1 and S2 demonstrate the ratios of lexical classes in the Adapted Turkish Affective List (ATAL) and Revised English List (REL). Table S3 contains the list of 127 Turkish words from the ATAL with valence and arousal ratings obtained from 61 native Turkish speakers. The word numbers of the equivalent words in the REL, retrieved from the ANEW 2010 dataset, the number of letters for both the English and Turkish words, case-insensitive word frequency reported as number of instances per million, and information on lexical classes are also included. Columns L and M, respectively, contain the ratio of valence ratings between 4 and 6 and arousal ratings equal to 5 for each word. Table S4 has a list of 15 words with more than one unit difference between their average Turkish and English ‎valence ratings while Table S5 contains the data for 40 words with over one point difference in their average arousal norms. Finally, Table S6 includes all the 508 Turkish words from the Expanded Turkish Affective List (ETAL), the ANEW words numbers for equivalents in the Expanded English List, number of letters, case-insensitivive frequency for Turkish words, and the mean, standard deviation, and standard errors for the valence and arousal norms from our Turkish native speakers.
